# Loan-Approval-Prediction
This project is a web application for predicting loan approval status based on various financial and personal attributes. It uses a machine learning model that I trained on historical loan data to make predictions. I built the web application using Flask for the web framework, SQLite for the database, and the pre-trained model saved with joblib.
